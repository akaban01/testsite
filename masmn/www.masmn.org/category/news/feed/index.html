<p>(SAINT PAUL, MN &#8211; For Immediate Release:  May 22, 2017)</p>
<p>Ramadan is the blessed month on the Islamic lunar calendar during which Muslims abstain from food and drink from sunup to sundown. In 2017, Ramadan is on May 27 &#8211; June 25.</p>
<p>In 2017, Masjids and Islamic Centers across Minnesota are extending an invitation to their non-Muslim neighbors for a traditional Ramadan Iftar, or fast-breaking meal.</p>
<p>People of all faiths or none are invited to experience one or more of the Ramadan open houses organized as part of the Taking Heart Open House program of the Minnesota Council of Churches in partnership with the Muslim American Society and participating mosques in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Taking Heart has been bringing Muslims and non-Muslims together for food and conversation for ten years. &#8220;In 2016 over 800 community members participated in Taking Heart during Ramadan. Our hope is that many more people will join us this year for an Iftar dinner, especially those who have never had the opportunity,&#8221; said The Rev. Cynthia Bronson Sweigert, Taking Heart Organizer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ramadan is a month of generosity and hospitality. We invite our neighbors to visit us and join us for a complimentary Iftar meal,&#8221; said Imam Asad Zaman.</p>
<p>These events are free and open to the public but registration is required. Information and registration materials can be found on the Minnesota Council of Churches website.</p>

<h3>Why Is This Important</h3>
<p>Many of us who watch the news today are wondering how to frame current events, how to grapple with our identities as Muslim Americans, and how to represent the beauty of Islam as a religion well within the boundaries of modern civil discourse.</p>
<p>This is your chance to join your brothers and sisters and have your voice heard. You will have the opportunity to meet State Legislators; discuss issues relating to education, immigration, healthcare, and civil rights; and bring about positive social change.</p>
